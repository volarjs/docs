Having a common framework for building editor tooling has many benefits. It allows us to share code, it allows us to share knowledge, and most importantly, it allows us to share the pain of building editor tooling.

Those pesky times where your mappings are off by one, or you're not sure what files are being included in your project, or there's a syntax error in your generated virtual code. We all know those times, and if you don't, you probably will soon.

Volar Labs is a VS Code extension to help you debug your Volar-powered language server and client. **It's the editor tooling for the people who make the editor tooling.**
