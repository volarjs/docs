title: Your First Volar Language Server
description: A guide in my new Starlight docs site.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

In this guide, we will create a simple Volar language server and VS Code client. To keep things simple, it will look suspiciously like HTML, albeit with one twist: Only one `<style>` tag will be allowed. **We'll call it HTML1.**

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) version 1.55 or higher.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 14 or higher.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.

## Getting Started

We'll first create a new project directory and initialize a new Node.js project.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
# create a new project with npm
npm init
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
# create a new project with pnpm
pnpm init .
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
# create a new project with yarn
yarn init .
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In order to be able to have both the language server and the VS Code client in the same repository, [a common pattern for language servers](/guides/file-structure), we'll create a new `packages` directory that will contain both parts, this is effectively known as a monorepo.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
# create a new project with npm
npm init -w ./packages/server
npm init -w ./packages/client
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
# create a new project with pnpm
mkdir -p ./packages/server ./packages/client
echo -e 'packages:\n  - "packages/*"' > pnpm-workspace.yaml
# Go into both newly created folders in packages and run `pnpm init`
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
# create a new project with yarn
yarn init -w ./packages/server
yarn init -w ./packages/client
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### The client

Since this guide mainly focuses on creating a server we'll start by creating the client so that we can get that out of the way. The client will be a VS Code extension, which necessitate [a `package.json` with a few specific fields](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/extension-manifest). As such, update your `package.json` to look like this:

```json
{
  "name": "client",
  "displayName": "HTML1 Client",
  "description": "A VS Code extension for HTML1.",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "engines": {
    "vscode": "^1.55.0"
  },
  "activationEvents": ["onLanguage:html1"],
  "main": "./src/extension.js",
  "contributes": {
    "languages": [
      {
        "id": "html1",
        "extensions": [".html1"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

We'll also be installing a few dependencies from Volar and VS Code. Run the following command to install them:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
# create a new project with npm
npm install @volar/language-server @volar/vscode vscode-languageclient ../server
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
# create a new project with pnpm
pnpm install @volar/language-server @volar/vscode vscode-languageclient ../server
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
# create a new project with yarn
yarn install @volar/language-server @volar/vscode vscode-languageclient ../server
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
