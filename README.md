## What is VolarJS?

VolarJS is a modern embedded language tooling framework that aims to simplify the development of language support for editors. It does this by providing a rich set of tools that helps you build a great editing experience for your language in any text editor like VS Code, Sublime Text, Vim, Emacs, etc.
